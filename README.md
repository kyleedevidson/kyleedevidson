- 👋 Hi, I’m @kyleedevidson. I was Kylee Davidson ... but I became a developer! Upgradesss!
- 👀 I’m interested in pentesting, quantum computing, theoretical physics, network security, and Kali Linux. I find almost anything interesting and love going down rabbit holes to learn something new :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about site reliability engineering, virtual machines, and the history of CPU architectures. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Kali KDE applications! I'm also open to any kind of cybersecurity volunteer work!
- 📫 How to reach me ... is a mystery to all. Maybe try astral projection! Or LinkedIn.
